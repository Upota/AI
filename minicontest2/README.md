# Goal
minicontest 2 is an adversarial game, involving two teams competing against each other. Each team will try to eat the food on the far side of the map, while defending the food on home side.  
The agents are in the form of ghosts on home side and Pacmen on opponentâ€™s side. Also, the agents are now able to __eat opponent when they are a ghost__ If a Pacman is eaten by a ghost before reaching his own side of the board, he will explode into a cloud of food dots that will be deposited back onto the board.  
       
Implement a variety of behavioral rule algorithms with my own heuristic value functions.
